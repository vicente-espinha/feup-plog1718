Projects for the Logic Programming (PLOG) class of the Master in Informatics and Computer Engineering (MIEIC) at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP). 

### TP1

This project implements a board game (Dameo) for two players. There are two types of players: Human and Computer. The game allows three modes: Human vs Human, Human vs Computer and Computer vs Computer. It was developed in SICStus Prolog.

### TP2

The goal of this project is the construction of a program in Programming in Logic with Restrictions to solve one of the problems of optimization or combinatorial decision suggested in this statement. In addition, an article describing the work done and the results obtained should be prepared.

**Development System** : The recommended development system is SICStus Prolog, which includes a finite domain constraint resolution module: clp (FD).

**Game** : Bosnian Snakes
